    <h1>April 2025</h1>
    <p>I have a beautiful view of Bangkok. I have a pool, gym and this weekend is Songkran, Thai new years. Everyone showers each other with water to signify cleaning bad luck away. I can’t because I have an eye infection and water would make it worse. I’ve been in my room for several days because I don’t want to infect others. Got on Discord to speak to folks a bit which was nice. Got off a 3 hour call with Sharon talking about deep things.</p>

    <p>Topic: being present, forgiving yourself, and loving yourself. I don’t do or am any of those. I’m not at peace. I’m doing my best, as much as I can when I can. But I’m not at peace. I don’t feel safe yet and I don’t know when I’ll feel that again apart from Auntie’s house, Steph’s, Maggie’s or Bunso/Mush’s. It’s like the location and people make me feel safe. Here I don’t have any of that yet and I am lacking the bandwidth or in this case physical capacity to build it still. And since I don’t have it, food has been my comfort which goes against my fitness and wellness goal.</p>

    <p>So here I am. Sitting with the discomfort and seeing what is in my power to change. I will be the victor, not the victim. I will thrive. I will thrive.</p>
